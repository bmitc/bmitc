My education is in mathematics with a smattering of physics and electrical engineering. In my career as a software engineer, I have spent all of my time either using a visual programming language or a functional programming language and sometimes both. Most of my work has interacted with hardware or science in some form or fashion, and I like that. The tools I have used are often viewed as strange and are admittedly uncommon, but surprisingly, they have almost always been the right tool.
